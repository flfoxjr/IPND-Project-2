    <h3>Secondary School</h3>
    <div class="side-by-side">
      <div>
         After attending 7 primary schools through my first 6 years of school, I completed primary school at <b>Ira Murphy</b>, in Peoria, Arizona.
         I then received a variance to attend <b>Cactus High School</b>, in Glendale, AZ.
         This decision was driven solely by my desire to join <em>Air Force Junior ROTC</em>, which wasn't offered at the high school I was supposed to go to.
         So, I started over with a new school, like I had many times before, where I didn't know anyone. Cactus would be the first school that I'd
         start and finish, without transferring. I met some of my closest friends while in high school that are still with me to this day.
         I enjoyed a variety of events in high school, such as ROTC campouts, ROTC trips to San Diego, to visit the North Island Naval Air Station, and Naval
         Amphibious Base, Coronado. We visited Six Flags Magic Mountain, volunteered at a number of events, and completed my cadet career as a Cadet Captain.

           The true highlight of my high school career would be the two years I spent in marching and concert bands. My final two years of high school
           I was honored to be a member of the Drumline, playing the marching tenors. I took a number of exciting trips with the band to various highschools
           in the state, various marching band competitions, and two trips to California to march in the Disney Magic Music Days parade. It was
           during my time on Drumline that I met the girl who would eventually be my wife, Amanda. Throughout highschool, we were only friends, but soon
           after I graduated in 1999, we started dating.<br>

          After high school, I enrolled in an <em>Associates in Applied Science</em> in <em>Computer Aided Drafting and Design</em>, at <b>ITT Tech</b>, which I completed in 18 months.
          I started working for an architect while in school, doing drafting. After a year or so working in architecture, I quit working and went
          back to school, this time at <b>Arizona State University</b>, for architecture. That program would prove to be too demanding with my new work schedule,
          as a restaurant server, which I was holding at the time. I eventually changed programs to <em>Housing and Urban Development</em>, which I stayed with for
          two more years, before leaving college to start working as a full-time draftsman at a steel-joist manufacturer. Eventually, I would move from there
          to a high-end aluminum residential window and door manufacturer, as a project manager. I did that for about three years, before getting laid off in the <b>Great Recession</b>.
          I quickly found a job working as a tech support agent for <b>University of Phoenix</b>, helping students and faculty with various tech issues with their computers,
          the school website, or any electronic materials. As a perk of employment, I was able to finish my <em>Bachelor's Degree</em> after transferring in my credits from ASU, and switched
          my final program to <em>Information Technology - Web Development</em>. After a few years in tech support, I moved into Quality Assurance. I can finally say, <em>"Yes, they really
          do record your calls for quality and training purposes"</em>. I spent a few years coaching agents on best practices, helping them improve their support of the students and faculty,
          as well as honing their customer service skills. After a few years I moved to the Analytics team, where I spent time learning SQL and using Excel to analyze business operations
          for the call center. I typically would drill into our biggest categories for call volume, research the data around those calls, and come up with busines recommendations in order
          to help improve business operations. Since then, I've moved to a new company called Sono Bello, where I work as a Business Operations Analyst. I spend most of my time reporting out
          financial, labor, marketing, and other operations data for the business. As much as I enjoy what I do and who I work with, I feel this drive to get into my true interest, which is
          programming of some, so that brought me to <b>Udacity!</b> Going forward I hope to learn about full stack development as well as Android development, in hopes I can cross-integrate them
          on future projects.
