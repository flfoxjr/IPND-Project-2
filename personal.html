        I was born to Ann Shirley Fox and Frank Lewis Fox Sr., on November 7th, 1980.
        I have 3 brothers, 2 of which are half-brothers, Steven and Shawn,
        1 which is adopted, Michael. I also have 2 half-sisters, Jennifer and Jeanette.
        All of my half-siblings come from my mother, and all are separated from me by
        18 years or more. My adopted brother, Michael, is actually my nephew from my half-sister,
        Jennifer, who wasn't up for taking care of him when he was born, so my parents legally
        adopted him. He is 5 years older than me.<br>
        My early life was busy, as many childhoods are; full of
        short trips with my parents, spending vast time in the various regions we lived in,
        via car. As I mentioned before, I lived in 2 countries, and 4 U.S. states. When we lived in
        New Mexico, we'd often traverse the mountains and desert, venturing off-road in a Volvo or
        Subaru station wagon. In Texas we lived near the coast, so we spent a lot of time meandering
        the Texas coastline between Port Arthur & Galveston, often looking for shells to add to my mom's
        huge collection. In Michigan we traveled all over the state, and enjoyed fishing in the
        various lakes and rivers of the mitten state. In Arizona, similar to New Mexico, we would
        go all over the desert, follow railroad tracks, stopping to look for interesting rocks or
        artifacts that were cast off trains traveling through the region.

        Following is the list of places I've lived in my life, listed in chronological order:

        <h3>Adolescence</h3>
           After settling in Peoria, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, I started to find
           a variety of new interests in life. Through school I was starting to get exposure
           to computers, thanks to a keyboarding class that was part of my 6th grade curriculum.
           During that class we used <em>Apple Macintosh Classic II</em> computers, and beyond keyboarding
           we often had a chance to play <em>SimCity</em>, which was fun. Along with my interest in tech, I
           also took an interest in art, band, and choir. In 6th grade I joined band and learned
           to play the Alto Saxophone, for the rest of my elementary and middle school years.<br>
           <br>

           As I moved into high school, I was interested in a potential career in the <em>Air Force</em>, as
           my father had done; as such, I elected to go to a high school that had <em>Air Force Junior ROTC</em>.
           ROTC would bring me discipline, focus, and experiences that have stuck with me my entire adilt life.
           I met my best friend while in ROTC, and have maintained a long term connection with many of those
           fellow cadets from my high school career.<br>
           <br>

           In addition to ROTC, starting Sophomore year I focused on trying to become a member of the band.
           I became very interested in marching band, and drumline specifically, so I enrolled in beginning
           band in order to learn percussion. Through beginning band I met a few guys both on the current drumline,
           and a few looking to make the line the following year, similar to me. Those guys would help me hone
           my skills and prepare me for the drumline audition in the spring. I would make the line for my Junior
           year and also my Senior. Marching band and Drumline brought me a number of close friends, my first long-term
           girlfriend, great times and experiences; triumphs, heartaches, and adrenaline. I still very much cherish
           that part of my life, to this day, and still enjoy watching marching band and Drumline videos on YouTube.<br>
           <br>

           As many U.S. adolescents do, I received my driver's license just after turning 16. Soon after that, my dad
           gave me his old car, a <em>1988 Chevy Sprint</em> hatchback, in red. I spent much of my first few years driving taking
           short road trips, seeing the state of Arizona in all of its splendor. Unfortuantely, I didn't really get
           an education on how to care for a vehicle, so didn't know about things like oil changes, or tire pressures.
           As a result, my car only lasted about 18 months, as it blew a head gasket and even with repair, it never was
           able to run normally, again. I had a number of great experiences in that vehicle, though, and I'm thankful for that.<br>
           <br>

           In my final year of high school, I became close friends with a girl named Amanda Moore. Our friendship grew over time
           and by July, just after I graduated, we were finally going on our first real date. I took her to the <em>Hard Rock Cafe</em>
           in my mom's white <em>Dodge Neon</em>, and then spent the rest of the evening just enjoying driving around together.
           It was the start of the greatest relationship I've had in my life, and that continues 18 years later.<br>

        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
          <div>
            While my girlfriend Amanda would go off to Tucson for university, I stayed in Phoenix to start my own path. We stayed
            together through it all, though. I went through my own educational endeavors (available on the <a href="school-work.html">School & Work Experience</a> page).
            While I was going to school, I worked various odd jobs, as young people often do. I wored for an architect two different times,
            as a draftsman, then worked at a local Phoenix pizza chain called <em>Streets of New York</em>. I started as a counter guy,
            taking phone orders, handing out pickup orders, prepping delivery orders, and helping servers. I eventually became a server,
            then moved on to closing key person, who handled closing the restuarant and all aspects that went with that. I would go on to
            help the business open 2 new stores as a lead server/key person, and eventually became an Assistant Manager for one store. After
            leaving that role, I took something less demanding, so I could focus more on school, and started delivering pizza for <em>Domino's
            Pizza</em>, working under a manager who had worked for me as a server at <em>Streets of New York</em>. Domino's was my final job
            before starting my career with a steel-joist company.<br>
            <br>
            Around this time, Amanda finished school in Tucson and came home to Phoenix. I moved in with her at her parent's house, and decided
            it was time to start looking for a 'real job', so that led me to the joist company. Within a few months of starting that role, Amanda
            was ready for us to get our own apartment, so we did. We spent a year in our first apartment, while saving what little money we could
            to help with a down payment on our first home purchase. Unfortuantely for us, we got caught up in the hot housing market of 2005 and
            ended up buying an overpriced condo that, in the <em>Great Recession</em>, would lose 75% of it's value. All that aside, though, it was
            our first home and it allowed us to grow as a couple. We went through some very hard times in the 3 years  we lived there, but they
            were important experiences for us, and we're stronger for them. Along with our very first home together, we decided it was time for Amanda
            to have her first dog! So, we went to a local shelter one weekend and adopted Maisy, a 5-year old Corgi mix. She has been the light of our
            lives for going on 13 years now, and she's 18 years old now.<br>
            <br>
            In 2008, during the beginning of the recession, we bought our standalone home, and elected to rent out our condo. After moving into our
            house we added a second dog, Cody. He was 8 when we got him, and stayed with us for 6 years before he passed on. He was a great companion
            and got us, and me, through so many tough times. He was my buddy and we definitely had a strong bond.
